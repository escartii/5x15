# 5x15 Drag & Drop Puzzle

**5x15** is a simple web-based puzzle game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The objective is to arrange the numbered tiles into ordered sequences according to their colors. You can shuffle the board by either letting the game generate a random seed or by setting one manually. The game also features different difficulty levels, affecting how many tiles you must align before you can “swipe” a sequence off the board.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop**: Move tiles around with your mouse using standard HTML5 drag-and-drop.
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Level 1, 2, or 3, which determines how many tiles form a valid sequence.
- **Random or Manual Seeding**: Let the game randomly seed your deck, or enter a custom seed to reproduce the same starting layout.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple controls—just drag, drop, and watch the tiles snap into place if it’s a valid move.
- **Responsive Design**: Works nicely on both desktop and mobile devices.
